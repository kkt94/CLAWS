Once this is proved, condition (b) implies that $x_1 + x_{n-1} = x_1 + (n-1)x_1 = nx_1 = 2n$. Therefore $x_1 = 2$, and the sequence is just the even numbers from $2$ to $2n-2$. The sequence of successive even numbers clearly satisfies all three conditions, and we are done.\nFirst a degenerate case. If $n = 2$, there is only one element $x_1$, and condition (b) gives $x_1 + x_1 = 4$ or $x_1 = 2$. Conditions (a) and (c) are vacuously true.\nOtherwise, for $n > 2$, we will prove by induction on $m$ that the difference $x_{n-m} - x_{n-1-m} = x_1$ for all $m \\in [1, n-2]$, which makes all the differences $x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} = \\ldots = x_2 - x_1 = x_1$, i.e. the sequence is an arithmetic progression with $x_1$ as the first term and increment as promised.\nSo first the $m=1$ case. With $n > 2$, $x_{n-2}$ exists and is less than $x_{n-1}$ by condition (a). Now since by condition (b) $x_1 + x_{n-1} = 2n$, we conclude that $x_1 + x_{n-2} < 2n$, and therefore by condition (c) $x_1 + x_{n-2} = x_k$ for some $k$.  Now, since $x_1 > 0$, $x_k > x_{n-2}$ and can only be $x_{n-1}$.  So $x_1 + x_{n-2} = x_{n-1}$.\nNow for the induction step on all values of $m$. Suppose we have shown that for all $i \\le m$, $x_1 + x_{n-1-i} = x_{n-i}$.  If $m = n-2$ we are done, otherwise $m < n-2$, and by condition (c) $x_1 + x_{n-2-m} = x_k$ for some $k$. This $x_k$ is larger than $x_{n-2-m}$, but smaller than $x_1 + x_{n-1-m} = x_{n-m}$ by the inductive hypothesis. It then follows that $x_1 + x_{n-2-m} = x_{n-1-m}$, the only element of the sequence between $x_{n-2-m}$ and $x_{n-m}$. This establishes the result for $i=m+1$.\nSo, by induction $x_1 + x_{n-1-m} = x_{n-m}$ for all $m \\in [1, n-2]$, which completes the proof.\nProof 2:\nLet $S=\\{x_1,x_2,...,x_{n-1}\\}$. Notice that \\[x_1 < x_1+x_1 < x_1+x_2 < \\dots < x_1+x_{n-2} < 2n.\\]\nThen by condition (c), we must have $x_1,x_1+x_1,...,x_1+x_{n-2}\\in S$. This implies that $x_1=x_1,x_1+x_1=x_2,...,x_1+x_{n-2}=x_{n-1}$, or that $x_k=kx_1$. Then we have $x_1+x_{n-1}=n(x_1)=2n \\rightarrow x_1=2$, and the rest is trivial.",

This means that if $x_i$ is an element in this sequence then $-x_i$ is as well.\n$a,b,2n-a,2n-b$ are all elements in the sequence. Clearly, one of $2n-a+b$ and $2n-b+a$ is less than $2n$, which means that $\\pm (a-b)$ are in this sequence modulo $n$.\nNow we want to show every number is achievable. We have already established that $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, so by euclidean algorithm, if we take the positive difference of $a'$ and $b'$ every time, we will get that $1$ is in our sequence. Then, we can simply add or subtract $1$ as many times from $a$ as desired to get every single number.\nWe have proved that there are no two numbers that can be relatively prime in our sequence, implying that no two consecutive numbers can be in this sequence. Because our sequence has $n-1$ terms, our sequence must be one of $2,4,6,..,2(n-1)$ or $1,3,5,...$, the latter obviously fails, so $2,4,6...2(n-1)$ is our only possible sequence.",

Adding $x_1$ to both sides, $2x_1>x_1$. Therefore, since the $n-2$ expressions are all at least $2x_1$, they have to be equal to $x_2, x_3, \\dots, x_{n-1}$.\nSince there are $n-2$ distinct expressions $x_1+x_i$ equal to $n-2$ distinct expressions $x_j$, we have that each $x_1+x_i$ is equal to one $x_j$.
