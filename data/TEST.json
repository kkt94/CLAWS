If the larger number were twice the smaller number, then the smallest possibility for the larger number is $2457\\times2=4914$, since $2457$ is the smallest number in the set. The largest possibility would have to be twice the largest number in the set such that when it is multiplied by $2$, it is less than or equal to $7542$, the largest number in the set. This happens to be $2754\\times2=5508$. Therefore, the number would have to be between $4914$ and $5508$, and also even. The only even numbers in the set and in this range are $5472$ and $5274$. A quick check reveals that neither of these numbers is twice a number in the set. The number can't be quadruple or more another number in the set since $2457\\times4=9828$, well past the range of the set. Therefore, the number must be triple another number in the set. The least possibility is $2457\\times3=7371$ and the greatest is $2475\\times3=7425$, since any higher number in the set multiplied by $3$ would be out of the range of the set. Reviewing, we find that the upper bound does in fact work, so the multiple is $2475\\times3=7425, \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}}$\n\nOr, since the greatest number possible divided by the smallest number possible is slightly greater than 3, divide all of the choices by 2, then 3 and see if the resulting answer contains 2,4,5 and 7.

Also, each side of the octagon is equal, because of the definition of regular shapes. Let $s$ be the length of a leg of the isosceles right triangle. In terms of $s$, the hypotenuse of the isosceles right triangle, which is also the length of a side of the regular octagon, is $s \\sqrt{2}$. Since the length of each side of the square is 2000, the length of each side of the regular octagon is equal to the length of a side of the square ($2000$) subtracted by $2$ times the length of a leg of the isosceles right triangle ( the total length of the side is $2s+ o$, $o$ being the length of a side of the regular octagon), which is the same as $2s$. As an expression, this is $2000-2s$, which we can equate to $s \\sqrt{2}$, ( since the octagon is regular, meaning all of the side's lengths are congruent) giving us the following equation:$2000-2s = s \\sqrt{2}$. By isolating the variable and simplifying the right side, we get the following: $2000 = s(2 + \\sqrt{2})$. Dividing both sides by $(2 + \\sqrt{2})$, we arrive with $\\frac{2000}{2 + \\sqrt{2}} = s$, now, to find the length of the side of the octagon, we can plug in $s$ and use the equation $2000-2s = o$, $o$ being the length of a side of the octagon, to derive the value of a side of the octagon. After plugging in the values, we derive $2000-2(\\frac{2000}{2 + \\sqrt{2}})$, which is the same as $2000-(\\frac{4000}{2 + \\sqrt{2}})$, factoring out a $2000$, we derive the following: $2000(1-(\\frac{2}{2 + \\sqrt{2}}))$, by rationalizing the denominator of $\\frac{2}{2 + \\sqrt{2}}$, we get $2000(1-(2 - \\sqrt{2}))$, after expanding, finally, we get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }2000(\\sqrt{2} -1)}$\u00a0!(not a factorial symbol, just an exclamation point)"

Thus, we have at least one pair of elements out of $1985$ elements.  Removing these two elements yields $1983$ elements.  By applying the Pigeon Hole Principle again, we find that there exists another such subset.  Continuing on like this yields at least $734$ pairs of elements of $M$ whose product is a perfect square.  Let $S$ be the set of the square roots of the products of each pair. Then, by the Pigeon Hole Principle again, there exist at least two elements whose product is a perfect square.

Then the ordered tuple of divisors is of the form $(1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n)$ for some integer $a\\geq 1$. \nTo prove this claim, note that $p$ is the smallest prime that divides $n$, so it is the smallest divisor not equal to $1$, meaning the first $2$ divisors are $1$ and $p$. Furthermore, the smallest divisor of $n$ that is not equal to a power of $p$ (i.e. not equal to $(1,\\, p,\\, p^2\\dots)$ is equal to $q$. This is because all other divisors either include a prime $z$ different from both $q$ and $p$, which is larger than $q$ (since $q$ and $p$ are the smallest two prime divisors of $n$), or don\u2019t include a different prime $z$. In the first case, since $z>q$, the divisor is larger than $q$. In the second case, all divisors divisible by $q^2$ are also larger than $q$, and otherwise are of the form $p^x \\cdot q^1$ or $p^x$ for some nonnegative integer $x$. If the divisor is of the form $p^x$, then it is a power of $p$. If it is of the form $p^x \\cdot q^1$, the smallest of these factors is $p^0 \\cdot q^1 = q$. Therefore, (in the case where $2$ or more primes divide $n$) the ordered tuple of divisors is of the form $(1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n)$ for some integer $a\\geq 1$, since after each divisor $p^x$, the next smallest divisor is either $p^{x+1}$ or simply $q$. \nIf $a\\geq 2$, the condition fails. This is because $p^{a-1} \\nmid p^a + q$, since $p^a$ is divisible by $p^{a-1}$, but $q$ is not since it is a prime different from $p$. If $a=1$, then $p^{a-1}=p^0=1$, which does divide $q$. Therefore $a$ must equal $1$ for the condition to be satisfied in this case. However, we know that the ordered list of divisors satisfies $d_i \\cdot d_{k+1-i}=n$, meaning since the first $3$ divisors are $(1, p, q)$, then the last $3$ divisors are $(\\frac{n}{q}, \\frac{n}{p}, n)$, so $(\\frac{n}{q})$ must divide $(\\frac{n}{p} + n)$. But $\\frac{n}{q}$ is divisible by $p$, so $\\frac{n}{p} + n$ must also be divisible by $p$, but since $a=1$ $\\frac{n}{p}$ is and $n$ isn't.\nWhen $n=p^x$, it is easy to verify this works for all primes $p$ and all $x\\geq 2$, since $p^y  \\vert  p^{y+1} + p^{y+2}$, and the divisors are ordered as ${1,\\, p,\\, p^2\u2026\\, p^x}$.

All divisors of $n$ which contain a factor of $p_k$ for $k \\geq 2$ is at least as large as $p_2$. So, the only divisors which are possibly less than $p_2$ are of the form  $p_1^{j}$. Also, by construction $p_1$ is less than $p_2$. Putting it all together, this says that the smallest factors are $(1, p_1, \\dots, p_1^j, p_2)$ for some $j \\geq 1$.\nIf $j \\geq 2$, then $p_1^{j-1} \\nmid p_1^j + p_2$, since the LHS has a factor of $p_1$ and the RHS does not since.\nIf $j = 1$, then the largest three factors are $(\\frac{n}{p_2}, \\frac{n}{p_1}, n)$.

The well-definedness of this function is evident due to the existence and uniqueness, and it satisfies the equation \\( P(x): \\quad xf(g(x)) + f(x)g(x) \\leq 2 \\) while applying the same property for \\( x \\mapsto g(x) \\) gives another unique \\( y\u00a0:= g(g(x)) \\) such that \\( g(x)f(y) + yf(g(x)) \\leq 2 \\).

Let's define the set of fixed points of \\( g \\) as \\( \\mathcal{S}\u00a0:= \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^+ \\mid g(x) = x \\} \\) and show that \\( \\mathcal{S} = \\mathbb{R}^+ \\) is the entire domain.\nAssume for a contradiction that some \\( x \\notin \\mathcal{S} \\) is not a fixed point, i.e., \\( x \\neq g(x) \\). Then, the inequality \\( 2xf(x) > 2 \\) (derived from \\( y \\mapsto x \\)) holds, implying \\( f(x) > \\frac{1}{x} \\). Similarly, \\( x \\notin \\mathcal{S} \\) implies \\( g(x) \\notin \\mathcal{S} \\) (otherwise \\( g(x) \\in \\mathcal{S} \\) implies \\( x = g(g(x)) = g(x) \\), a contradiction), leading to \\( f(g(x)) > \\frac{1}{g(x)} \\).\nApplying these inequalities to \\( P(x) \\) gives \\( xf(g(x)) + f(x)g(x) < 2 \\), which is clearly a contradiction as \\( \\frac{x}{g(x)} + \\frac{g(x)}{x} \\geqslant 2 \\), e.g., from the AM-GM inequality. Therefore, we must have \\( x \\in \\mathcal{S} \\) for every \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R}^+ \\), i.e., \\( g(x) = x \\).\nSubstituting this relationship into the original equation, we obtain \\( P(x): \\quad xf(x) + f(x)x \\leq 2 \\implies xf(x) \\leq 1 \\implies f(x) \\leq \\frac{1}{x} \\) for every \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R}^+ \\).

The second part follows by contradiction: if the sum of a rational number and irrational number is rational, then the irrational number must be the difference of two rational numbers, which is rational. This is a contradiction; likewise for difference and product.\nThe LHS  of (*) is clearly rational (in fact, integral), and so the RHS must also be rational. This is the case for the first two terms $r^3p_2$ and $-(r-1)^3p_1$. But it is not the case for the third term. The number $(p_1p_2p_3)^\\frac{1}{3}$ is irrational because $p_1p_2p_3$, the product of three distinct primes, cannot be a perfect cube. Hence, $-3r(r-1)(p_1p_2p_3)^\\frac{1}{3}$, the product of a rational and an irrational number, is irrational, and the RHS is therefore the sum of two rational terms and one irrational term. This is irrational by the lemma, and hence we have a rational equalling an irrational, contradiction.

If he plays a blue card, then he is charged a penalty which is the number of white cards still in his hand. If he plays a white card, then he is charged a penalty which is twice the number of red cards still in his hand. If he plays a red card, then he is charged a penalty which is three times the number of blue cards still in his hand. Find, as a function of $R, W,$ and $B,$ the minimal total penalty a player can amass and all the ways in which this minimum can be achieved.",
        "solutions": {
            "1": "We claim (inductively) that the minimum is just going to be $\\min(BW,2WR,3RB)$. We'll start our induction with the case where one of the three quantities is zero, in which case we verify that we can indeed get away without any penalty by, for example, discarding blue if we are out of white.\nNow, for the inductive step, let $f(B,W,R)$ be the minimum we seek. Note that\n\\[f(B,W,R) = \\min(W+f(B-1,W,R),2R+f(B,W-1,R),3B+f(B,W,R-1))\\]\nBy our inductive hypothesis, $f(B-1,W,R) = \\min((B-1)W,2WR,3R(B-1))$. In order for this to cause our inductive step not to hold, we would require that $W+\\min((B-1)W,2WR,3R(B-1)) < \\min(BW,2WR,3RB)$. It is evident that the first two entries in the $min$ expression cannot cause this to happen, so that we need only consider $W+3R(B-1) < \\min(BW,2WR,3RB)$. So $W+3R(B-1) < BW$, whence $3R < W$. But $W+3R(B-1) < 3RB$, so that $W < 3R$, a contradiction.\nFor the other two cases, we can get similar contradictions, so that our inductive step must hold, and so $f(B,W,R)$ is indeed $\\min(BW,2WR,3RB)$.\nWe now need only establish how many ways to do this. If one of these quantities is smaller, our induction and the fact that it is eventually zero guarantees that it will continue to be the smallest quantity as cards are discarded. (For example, if it is currently optimal to discard a blue card, it will continue to be so until we run out of blue cards.) Therefore, assuming that there is currently only one best choice of card to discard, this will continue to be so in the future, whence if $BW \\neq 2WR \\neq 3RB$, there is only $1$ optimal strategy.\nSuppose, now, that $BW = 2WR$. It is thus optimal to discard either a $B$ or $W$ card. If we ever discard a blue card, then we will cause $BW < 2WR$, whence there is only one possible strategy from then on. However, if we discard a white card, then we will still have $BW = 2WR$, meaning that we continue to have the choice of discarding a white or blue card. Since we can discard a white card at most $W$ times, there are $W+1$ choices for how many $W$ cards to discard ($0$ to $W$), meaning that there are $W+1$ optimal strategies.\nBy similar logic, we get $R+1$ optimal strategies if $2WR = 3RB$, and $B+1$ optimal strategies if $3RB = BW$.\nThe final case, then, is if $BW = 2WR = 3RB$. In this case, if we first discard a white card, we are left with the $BW = 2WR$ case, and similarly for a blue and red card. The total number of optimal strategies in this case is then the sum of the optimal strategies in those cases, or, in other words, $B+W+R$.\nTo summarize:\nThe minimum penalty is $\\min(BW,2WR,3RB)$.\nIf $BW \\neq 2WR \\neq 3RB$, there is $1$ optimal strategy.\nIf $BW = 2WR < 3RB$, there are $W+1$ strategies.\nIf $2WR = 3RB < BW$, there are $R+1$ strategies.\nIf $3RB = BW < 2WR$, there are $B+1$ strategies.\nIf $BW = 2WR = 3RB$, there are $R+B+W$ strategies."

Begin by considering $C_0$ and $S_{00} = \\emptyset$. Then  given $S_{i0}$ we can create $S_{(i+1)0}$ by adding one element ($a_{i0}$). Using this, the number of ways to form the sequence of $S_{00}, S_{10}, \\dots, S_{n0}$ are $(2n)(2n-1) \\cdots (n+1)$ where we successively add one of the remaining elements of $[2n]$ to get consecutive terms in the sequence.\nNow consider when we are given $C_{j}$ and we need to find $C_{j+1}$. So far, there have been $n + j$ chosen distinct elements (via $S_{nj}$). After finding $C_{j+1}$ we will have $n + j + 1$ distinct elements and so in this process we only add one unique element to sets among $C_{j+1}$. There are $2n - (n+j) = n-j$ ways to chose such a new element called $x$.\nNow notice that $b_{0j}, a_{0(j+1)}, a_{1(j+1)}, \\dots, a_{(n-1)(j+1)}$ is a permutation of $x,  a_{0j}, \\dots, a_{(n-1)j}$ by noting $b_{nj} = x$ and,\n\\[S_{0j} + b_{0j} +  a_{0(j+1)} +  a_{1(j+1)} +  \\cdots +  a_{(n-1)(j+1)} = S_{n(j+1)} = S_{0j} +  a_{0j}+ a_{1j} +  \\cdots +  a_{(n-1)j} + b_{nj}\\]\nFurthermore,\n\\begin{align*} S_{0j} + b_{0j} + a_{0(j+1)} &= S_{1(j+1)} =  S_{0j} +  a_{0j} +  b_{1j} \\\\ S_{1j} + b_{1j} + a_{1(j+1)} &= S_{2(j+1)} = S_{1j} +  a_{1j} +  b_{2j} \\\\ &\\cdots \\\\ S_{(n-1)j} + b_{(n-1)j} + a_{(n-1)(j+1)} &= S_{n(j+1)} =  S_{(n-1)j} +  a_{(n-1)j} +  b_{nj} . \\end{align*}\nTherefore $b_{ij}, a_{i(j+1)}$ is a permutation of $a_{ij}, b_{(i+1)j}$ for $i < n$. Now let $k$ be the first $i$ such that $b_{ij} = x$. By definition, $b_{(k+1)j}, \\dots = x$. Then the number of ways to order $x,  a_{0j}, \\dots, a_{(n-1)j}$ is $2^{k-1}$ as there are 2 permutations for each pair before $\\{b_{ij}, a_{i(j+1)}\\} = \\{a_{ij}, b_{(i+1)j}\\}$ and each pair after is determined by $b_{ij}= b_{(i+1)j} = k, a_{i(j+1)} = a_{ij}$. For $k  = 0$, the permutation is completely determined so there is one way.\nOverall the number of ways to add the $j+1$'th row is, \\[(n-j)(1 + \\sum_{k = 1}^n 2^{k-1}) = 2^n(n-j).\\]\nIn total, there are $(2n)(2n-1)\\cdots (n+1)$ ways to find $C_0$ and for each $C_{j}$ there are $2^n(n-j+1)$ ways for $1 \\le j \\le n$.

Indeed, we would have\n\\[3-1 \\mid f(3)-f(1)\\]\nand so $2\\mid -1$, a contradiction.\n $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=2$\nWe claim $f(n)=n$ always by induction. The base cases are $n = 1$ and $n = 2$. Fix $k > 1$ and suppose that $f(k)=k$.  By Equation (1) we have that\n\\[f(k+1)! \\equiv k! \\mod k\\cdot k! .\\]\nThis implies $f(k+1)<2k$ (otherwise $f(k+1)!\\equiv 0 \\mod k\\cdot k!$). Also we have\n\\[(k+1)-1  \\mid  f(k+1)-f(1)\\]\nso $f(k+1)\\equiv 1 \\mod k$. This gives the solutions $f(k+1)=1$ and $f(k+1)=k+1$. The first case is obviously impossible, so $f(k + 1) = k + 1$, as desired.  By induction, $f(n) = n$ for all $n$.  This also satisfies the requirements.\n $f(1)=f(2)=2$\nWe claim $f(n)=2$ by a similar induction. Again if $f(k)=2$, then by (1) we have\n\\[f(k+1)\\equiv 2 \\mod k\\cdot k!\\]\nand so $f(k+1)<2k$.  Also note that\n\\[k+1-1  \\mid  f(k+1)-2\\]\nand\n\\[k+1-2  \\mid  f(k+1)-2\\]\nso $f(k+1)\\equiv 2 \\mod k(k-1)$. Then the only possible solution is $f(k+1)=2$. By induction, $f(n) = 2$ for all $n$, and this satisfies all requirements.\n\nIn summary, there are three solutions: $\\boxed{f(n)=1, f(n)=2, f(n)=n}$."

Let $a_x = 1$ for all prime numbers $x<Q$, and $a_{xy}=a_xa_y$, then (*) becomes:\n\\[Pa_P + Qa_Q = C_1\\]\nCase (ii): $2Q\\le n$ but $3Q > n$. In this case, let $a_2=-1$, and $a_x = 1$ for all prime numbers $2<x<Q$, and $a_{xy}=a_xa_y$, then (*) becomes:\n\\[Pa_P + Qa_Q - Qa_{2Q} = C_2\\]\nor\n\\[Pa_P - Qa_Q = C_2\\]\nCase (iii): $3Q\\le n$. In this case, let $a_2=3$, $a_3=-2$, and $a_x = 1$ for all prime numbers $3<x<Q$, and $a_{xy}=a_xa_y$, then (*) becomes:\n\\[Pa_P + Qa_Q + 3Qa_{2Q} - 2Qa_{3Q} = C_3\\]\nor\n\\[Pa_P + Qa_Q = C_3\\]\nIn each case, by Bezout's Theorem, there exists non zero integers $a_P$ and $a_Q$ which satisfy the equation.

Thus $d$ must the be the base of the isosceles triangle in $Q$, from which it follows that the isosceles triangle is $\\triangle P_aP_{a+k/2}\\,P_{a+k}$, and so $2|k$. Repeating this process on the legs of isosceles triangle ($\\overline{P_aP_{a+k/2}},\\,\\overline{P_{a+k}P_{a+k/2}}$), it follows that $k = 2^m$ for some positive integer $m$ (if we allow , then we can also let $m=0$). \nNow take the isosceles triangle $P_xP_yP_z,\\,0 \\le x < y < z < n$ in the triangulation that contains the center of $\\mathcal{P}$ in its interior; if a diagonal passes through the center, select either of the isosceles triangles with that diagonal as an edge.

For $k>1$, we construct the diagonals of equal length $\\overline{P_0P_{2^{k-1}}}$ and $\\overline{P_{2^{k-1}+1}P_0}$. This partitions $\\mathcal{P}$ into $3$ regions: an isosceles $\\triangle P_0P_{2^{k-1}}P_{2^{k-1}+1}$, and two other regions. For these two regions, we can recursively construct the isosceles triangles defined above in the second paragraph. It follows that we have constructed $2(2^{k-1}-1) + (1) = 2^k-1 = n-2$ isosceles triangles with non-intersecting diagonals, as desired.  \nWe construct the diagonals $\\overline{P_0P_2},\\ \\overline{P_2P_4},\\ \\ldots \\overline{P_{2n-2}P_0}$. This partitions $\\mathcal{P}$ into $n$ isosceles triangles of the form $\\triangle P_{2k}P_{2k+1}P_{2k+2}$, as well as a central regular polygon with $n$ sides. However, we know that there exists a triangulation for the $n$-sided polygon that yields $n-2$ isosceles triangles. Thus, we have created $(n) + (n-2) = 2n-2$ isosceles triangles with non-intersecting diagonals, as desired. \nIn summary, the answer is all $n$ that can be written in the form $2^{a+1} + 2^{b},\\, a,b \\ge 0$. Alternatively, this condition can be expressed as either $n=2^{k},\\, k \\ge 2$ (this is the case when $a+1 = b$) or $n$ is the sum of two distinct powers of $2$, where $1= 2^0$ is considered a power of $2$."

Consider flipping a weighted coin whether to choose the positive number or its negation for each positive number; it chooses positive with probability p. The pairs with both numbers same are chosen with probability p, the pairs (k, -k) are chosen with probability 1, and the pairs (x, y) for distinct x and y that sum to a nonzero number are chosen with probability $1-p^2$.

The expected number of points scored is $Ap + (68-A)(1-p^2)$. We want to prove this is larger than 42 at all times for some choice of p. If $A < 36$, $1/2$ works for p to give this bound. If $A > 36$, $5/8$ works for p for p to give the desired bound. If $A = 36$, we can use $3/5$ for p to get the desired bound. Hence, in any case, the expected value for the number of points scored across all of these weighted processes is larger than 42, so there exists some case that gives a score of 43.

The only way to turn up the second ace is to turn up the first, and then turn up the second, which requires $2$ moves. This indeed is equal to $(3 + 1)/2$. Next, we assume that the expected number of cards required to pull the second ace from a deck of n cards is in fact $(n + 1)/2$. Now, we see that to simulate the case with $n + 1$ cards, we simply must add a card to our deck. By our assumption, we can expect to turn up $(n + 1)/2$ cards to be turned up, including our second ace. Thus ahead of our second ace, we expect $(n - 1)/2$ cards , and after it $(n - 1)/2$ as well. When we add our card, it is ahead of the second ace half the time, and behind if half the time. Therefore we expect to add one card to the number of cards drawn half the time, and add nothing for half the time. Hence we expect to add half a card, and the expected value is now $((n + 1)/2) + 1/2)$, or $(n + 2)/2$, the desired outcome for the $n + 1$ case.",

If we draw the deck backwards (which has equal probability as drawing it forwards), then we will draw it in the $n+1-k$th place, since the $n$th place will become the first, the $n-1$th the second, etc.\nAlso, note that when second ace is still the second ace when we draw the deck backwards.

Also, let $E(a), E(b), E(c), E(d)$ denote the expected value of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ over all decks $D$. Then $a + b + c + d = n - 3$ (the deck minus the three aces).\nFor every deck $D$, there must exist other decks that permute the values of $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$. (i.e. if there is a deck with $a = 2, b = 3, c = 1, d = 4,$ there exists a deck with $a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4$.) Therefore, the value of $a$ over all decks $D$ is a permutation of the value of $b$ over all such decks, and as a result $E(a) = E(b)$. A similar result holds for $b$, $c$, and $d$, and so $E(a) = E(b) = E(c) = E(d)$. Because \\[E(a) + E(b) + E(c) + E(d) = E(a + b + c + d) = E(n-3) = n-3,\\] $E(a) = E(b) = \\frac{n-3}{4}$.

Therefore $\\triangle{C'DB}$ is the unique triangle mentioned above, so $\\triangle{CDB}$ is congruent, in some order of vertices, to $\\triangle{C'DB}$.  Since $\\triangle{CDB} \\cong \\triangle{C'DB}$ would imply $\\triangle{CDB} = \\triangle{C'DB}$, making quadrilateral $ABCD$ degenerate, we must have $\\triangle{CDB} \\cong \\triangle{C'BD}$.\nSince the perimeter of $ABCD$ is $640$, $AD + BC = 640 - 180 - 180 = 280$.  Hence $280 = AD + BC = AD + DC'$.  Drop the altitude of $\\triangle{ABC'}$ from $B$ and call the foot $P$.  Then right triangle trigonometry on $\\triangle{APB}$ shows that $\\cos{A} = AP/AB = 140/180 = 7/9$, so $\\lfloor 1000 \\cos A \\rfloor = \\boxed{777}$."

However, it should be fairly clear that the way to minimize $l\\cdot m\\cdot n$ is to make $l$ and $m$ and $n$ as close together as possible, which occurs when the smaller block is $3 \\times 7 \\times 11$.  Then the extra layer makes the entire block $4\\times8\\times12$, and $N= \\boxed{384}$.\nAn alternate way to visualize the problem is to count the blocks that can be seen and subtract the blocks that cannot be seen.  In the given block with dimensions $l\\times m \\times n$, the three faces have $lm$, $mn$, and $ln$ blocks each.  However, $l$ blocks along the first edge, $m$ blocks along the second edge, and $n$ blocks along the third edge were counted twice, so they must be subtracted.  After subtracting these three edges, 1 block has not been counted - it was added three times on each face, but subtracted three times on each side.  Thus, the total number of visible cubes is $lm+mn+ln-l-m-n+1$, and the total number of invisible cubes is $lmn-lm-mn-ln+l+m+n-1$, which can be factored into $(l-1)(m-1)(n-1)$."

If $c$ has a factor of $5^3$, then there are two cases: either (1) $a$ or $b = 5^32^3$, or (2) one of $a$ and $b$ has a factor of $5^3$ and the other a factor of $2^3$. For case 1, the other number will be in the form of $2^x5^y$, so there are $4 \\cdot 4 = 16$ possible such numbers; since this can be either $a$ or $b$ there are a total of $2(16)-1=31$ possibilities. For case 2, $a$ and $b$ are in the form of $2^35^x$ and $2^y5^3$, with $x < 3$ and $y < 3$ (if they were equal to 3, it would overlap with case 1). Thus, there are $2(3 \\cdot 3) = 18$ cases.\nIf $c$ does not have a factor of $5^3$, then at least one of $a$ and $b$ must be $2^35^3$, and both must have a factor of $5^3$.

The outward tetrahedron for the midpoint triangle provides $3$ of the faces, while the three equilateral triangles surrounding the midpoint triangle provide the other $3$. This is because if you read this question carefully, it asks to add new tetrahedra to each face of $P_{i}$ which also includes the ones that were left over when we did the previous addition of tetrahedra. However, the volume of the tetrahedra being constructed decrease by a factor of $\\frac 18$.

Call a stone in piling 1 wrong if the stone occupies a position such that there are more stones in that position in piling 1 than piling 2. Similarly define a wrong stone in piling 2. Let a wrong stone be at $(a, b)$ in piling 1. Since $c_b$ is the same for both pilings, we must have a wrong stone in piling 2 at column b, say at $(c, b)$, such that $c\\not = a$.

We prove that $A$ can win for $k=5$ (which hence proves it for $k<5$ as well) and show that $B$ can thwart $A$ for $k\\geq 6$.\nArrange the board so that a pair of opposite sides are horizontal. Create a coordinate system on the board by setting the center of some hexagon as the origin and setting the hexagons directly above and above-and-right as $(0, 1)$ and $(1, 0)$, respectively. Then, for example, the below-and-right hexagon touching the origin is $(1, -1)$. So two hexagons touch if their coordinate difference is one of these.\nNow for $k=5$, person $A$ places his counters only in $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\times\\{0, 1\\}$. Note that if, at $A$'s turn, there are 4 counters in either column, then $A$ can win immediately, so let us assume that in both columns there are at least 2 missing, meaning that at most $6$ counters are on the board. We would like to find when $A$ cannot play under these circumstances. If we look at the disjoint sets\n$\\{(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)\\}, \\{(1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1)\\}, \\{(3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)\\}, \\{(4, 1)\\}$\nwe see that either some set has at least $2$ hexagons without counters, in which case $A$ can move, or all four sets have exactly $1$ missing counter. Similarly for the sets\n$\\{(0, 0)\\}, \\{(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)\\}, \\{(2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0)\\}, \\{(3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1)\\}$\nSo both $(0, 0), (4, 1)$ have no token on them. This means that $(0, 1), (1, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)$ do. Thus $(3, 0)$ and $(1, 1)$ do not. So this is the only situation in which $A$ can neither win immediately nor play in only these 10 hexagons.\nSo $A$ plays only in these 10 hexagons until either he has a win or he can't anymore. If he wins, then we're done. Otherwise, $A$ plays in hexagons $(5, 0)$ and $(5, 1)$. Then $B$ either removes $(5, 1)$ so that $A$ can win at $(2, 0)$, or $B$ removes $(5, 0)$ and $A$ plays at $(5, 0)$ and $(4, 1)$ and then at either $(3, 0)$ or $(1, 1)$ the next turn, or $B$ removes one of $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\times\\{0, 1\\}$ in which case $A$ can either win immediately at $(3, 0)$ or can play in both columns, and then win the next turn.\nNow if $k\\geq 6$, then if $A$ plays on anything in the lattice generated by $(2, -1)$ and $(1, 1)$, that is $(2a+b, b-a)$ for $a, b$ integers, then $B$ removes it. Otherwise, $B$ removes any of $A$'s counters. This works because in order for $A$ to win, there must be at least 2 counters in this lattice, but $A$ can only put a counter on $1$ at any time, so there's at most 1 on the lattice at any time.\nSo $A$ wins if $k\\leq 5$, and $B$ wins if $k\\geq 6$."

Now call a beam z-oriented if its endpoints differ only in z-coordinates, and similarly call it x-oriented or y-oriented if the endpoints differ in x- or y-coordinates, respectively.\nWe claim that the answer is $\\boxed{3030}$. First we will prove 3030 suffices. Place the first beam so its endpoints lie at $(1, 1, 1)$, and $(2020, 1, 1)$. Place the 2nd beam so its endpoints lie at $(1, 1, 2)$ and $(1, 2020, 2)$. Place the 3rd beam so its endpoints lie at $(2, 2, 1)$ and $(2, 2, 2020)$. Now it is clear that the only faces among these three beams that are not touching the faces of the $2020 \\times 2020 \\times 2020$ cube of the face of another beam are the top face of beam 2, and the front and right faces of beam 3. \nNow place the 4th beam from $(1, 3, 3)$ to $(2020, 3, 3)$, 2 units up and right of beam 1.

Note that these 3 beams will touch the top face of beam 2, and the front and right faces of beam 3. Now the only faces that are not touching another face are the top of beam 5, and the front and right of beam 6. \nWe can repeat this process 1010 times, placing the beams in groups of 3 so that beam $3n+1$ is 2 units up and right of beam $3n-2$, beam $3n+2$ is 2 units forward and up of beam $3n-1$, and beam $3n+3$ is 2 units forward and right of beam $3n$, for all $1\\leq n \\leq 1009$. After placing each set of 3 as such, the faces of the previous beams will all satisfy condition 3. And for the last set of 3 (that is, beams 3028, 3029, and 3030), their faces will satisfy condition 3 as well, since the top face of beam 3029 and the front/right faces of beam 3030 will touch the cube (again, note that all other faces will be touching another beam).\nThus, we have shown that 3030 beams suffices, so we will now show that 3030 beams is the minimum. Let there be $A$ x-oriented beams, $B$ y-oriented beams, and $C$ z-oriented beams. Now look each $2020 \\times 1 \\times 2020$ slice of the cube, parallel to the xz-plane. Note there are 2020 such slices. There are two cases. Either $B=2020^2$, or at least one of A or C is nonzero. In the first case, we clearly have at least $2020^2>3030$ beams as desired. In the second case, we must have at least one beam in each $2020 \\times 1 \\times 2020$ slice, in order to satisfy condition 3. If there is some slice without a beam, then there will be some x- or z-oriented beam with no beams touching its top or bottom face. Additionally, notice that only x- or z-oriented beams can fit in a $2020 \\times 1 \\times 2020$ slice, so $A+C\\geq 2020$. Similarly, we must have $A=2020^2$, $C=2020^2$, or both $A+B\\geq 2020$ and $B+C\\geq 2020$. In every case, the number of beams, $A+B+C$, will be at least 3030 as desired."

Replacing the $1$ with a $2^x$ and dividing out the powers of two should create an easy induction proof which will be left to the reader as an Exercise.\nConsider $n = 25$.

Dividing the powers of $2$ from LHS gives $2^{2^n - 2k} - 1$ divides $2^n - 1$. Hence, $2^n - 2k$ divides $n$. Because $n = 25$ is odd, $2^{24} - k$ divides $25$.

Otherwise, time for our lemma:\nLemma: Define the function $f(p)$ to equal the number of integers x less than $b^p$ such that $S(x) \\ge b^p$. If $b^{p+1} = S(y)$ for some y, then $f(p+1) > f(p)$.\nProof: Let $F(p)$ be the set of integers x less than $b^p$ such that $S(x) \\ge b^p$. Then for every integer in $F(p)$, append the digit $(b-1)$ to the front of it to create a valid integer in $F(p+1)$. Also, notice that $(b-1) \\cdot b^p \\le y < b^{p+1}$. Removing the digit $(b-1)$ from the front of y creates a number that is not in $F(p)$. Hence, $F(p) \\rightarrow F(p+1)$, but there exists an element of $F(p+1)$ not corresponding with $F(p)$, so $f(p+1) > f(p)$.\nNote that our lemma combined with the Pigeonhole Principle essentially proves the claim.

Additionally, if we take any number, let's say $x$, and multiply it by $b^3$, and then add it to $b^2$ and $b^2 - b + 1$, we still obtain $f(b^3x + b^2) = f(b^3x + b^2 - b + 1)$, because we are simply adding $b^3x + x$ to each value. \nThus, we conclude that there are infinitely many numbers that are counted twice in $f(n)$, and that these numbers come $x^3$ apart. Finally, it is clear that for a large $N$, the number of numbers that are counted at least twice is at least $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{x^3}\\right\\rfloor$. Because $f(n) > n$ for all $n$, this means that there are at least $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{x^3}\\right\\rfloor$ numbers uncounted, and because this is unbounded, the proof is complete."

Note that by smallest, we mean the set whose greatest element is as small as possible. If $n=3$, then the smallest possible set, call it $\\{s_3\\},$ is trivially $\\{1,1,2\\}$, since $c_1$ and $c_2$ are obviously minimized and $c_3$ follows as minimal. Using this as the base case, we see inductively that in general $\\{s_n\\}$ is the set of the first $n$ Fibonacci numbers. To show this note that if $\\{s_n\\} = \\{F_0, F_1, ...

And since $\\{c\\}$ is bounded between $1$ and $n^2$, then the conditions of the problem are met if and only if $F_{n-1} > n^2$. The first $n$ for which this restriction is satisfied is $n=13$ and the exponential behavior of the Fibonacci numbers ensure that every $n$ greater than $13$ will also satisfy this restriction.

Thus, all $n$ such that $F_n \\le n^2$ do not work.\n3. It is easy to observe via a contradiction argument that all $n$ such that $F_n > n^2$ produce an acute triangle. (If, without loss of generality, $a_n$ is an increasing sequence, such that no three (in particular, consecutive) terms form an acute triangle, then $a_2^2 \\ge F_1a_1^2, a_3^2 \\ge a_2^2 + a_1^2 \\ge F_2a^2$, and by induction $a_n^2 > F_na_1^2$, a contradiction to the condition's inequality.)\n4.

Thus out of the given range for $m$ we know that ${n \\choose 2}$ and ${n \\choose n-2}$ are the minimum values, and all that is left is to prove that they are both greater than $n$. Furthermore, since ${n \\choose 2}={n \\choose n-2}$, we only have to prove that ${n \\choose 2}>n$.\nWe start with the given: $n>3$\n$\\Leftrightarrow$ $\\frac{n-1}{2}>1$\n$\\Leftrightarrow$ $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}>n$\n$\\Leftrightarrow$ $\\frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!}>n$\n$\\Leftrightarrow$ ${n \\choose 2}>n$\nThus we have proven the inequality for all even $n$.\nCase 2: $n$ is odd.\nThe greatest integer less than $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ is $\\frac{n-3}{2}$, so we know that:\n${n \\choose \\frac{n-1}{2}}>{n \\choose \\frac{n-3}{2}}>\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot>{n \\choose 2}$\nby induction.

Thus, the inequality holds true for odd and in turn all positive integers $n>3$.\n\nAs a result, due to our lemma, there are always more permutations of the columns than the number of columns itself, so there will always exist a permutation of the column such that there are no corresponding original columns of which to match with.

Let $k(C)$ be the number of distinct maximal grid-aligned configurations obtainable from $C$ by repeatedly sliding dominoes. Find the maximum value of $k(C)$ as a function of $n$.",

Trivially, $I$ is the centroid, orthocenter, and circumcenter of ABC (ABC is equilateral). Also, $AD=BE=CF=3r$ where $r$ is the radius of circle $\\omega$ (This is trivial). $T$ is the point of tangency of $\\omega$ and segment $\\overline{PQ}$. \n\nR has to lie on the intersection of circles $\\omega1$(center P, radius PA) and $\\omega2$(center Q, radius QB), and for each choice of P, there exist two locations for R.

We shall prove that K and T are the same point.\nLet $PT = p$ and $QT = q$. Because of the equal tangent theorem, $PD=PT=p$ and $QE=QT=q$. Hence, by the pythagorean theorem (recall $AD=BE=3r$), $PA^2 = 9r^2 + p^2$ and $QB^2 = 9r^2 + q^2$. Since PN = PA and QN = QB, then $PN^2 = 9r^2 + p^2$ and $QN^2 = 9r^2 + q^2$. \n\nPQ is the perpendicular bisector of MN because MN is the radical axis of $\\omega1$ and $\\omega2$. Hence, M is the reflection of N across K. Also, NK is the altitude of triangle PNQ, so $PK^2-QK^2 = PN^2-QN^2 = p^2 - q^2$ by using the pythagorean theorem and earlier expressions for $PN^2$ and $QN^2$. However, $PK+QK=PQ=p+q$. Now, we have a system of equations to solve for PK and QK in terms of p and q.\n\nDividing the first equation by the second (we can do this because p+q is always nonzero), we get $PK-QK=p-q$. Combining this with our PK+QK result, we get $PK = p$ and $QK = q$. However, $PT = p$ and $QT = q$, and only one point can exist on PQ for which this result holds true. As a result, K and T are the same point, otherwise it is a contradiction. Hence M, T, and N are collinear.\n\n$IT \\parallel MN$. This is because both MN and IT are perpendicular to PQ (IT is perpendicular to PQ because PQ is a tangent with point of tangency T). However, both lines share point T, as discussed earlier. Hence, IT and MN are the same line, and M, T, I, and N are collinear.\n\nIn fact, from our earlier results from the lengths of PN and PT, we can use the pythagorean theorem to get that $NT = 3r$, a result that is always true and independent of P and Q! Also, because M is the reflection of N over K (which is the same as T), $MT = 3r$ also. However, T varies based on P and Q. On the other hand, $IT = r$ and M, T, I and N are collinear. Remembering our earlier definitions of M and N, we get that $MI = 2r$ and $IN = 4r$, with M on the opposite side of N and T from I. Hence, M can be taken to N with a homothety about I with a factor of -2, and T can be taken to M with a homothety about I with a factor of -2. Since, trivially, the circumradius of ABC is 2r (ABC is equilateral), it seems like M can lie anywhere on the circumcircle of ABC.\n\nHowever, we must take into account the restrictions on P and Q. This limits T to only minor arc DE on the incircle of ABC, hence, because of our earlier homothety statement, M is restricted to minor arc AB on the circumcircle of ABC.  Because of our homothety statement about N, N has to lie on minor arc XY on the circumcircle of triangle XYZ.\n\nBecause we defined both M and N to be possible locations for R, $\\fbox{R can only lie on minor arc AB of the circumcircle of triangle ABC, and also on minor arc XY of the circumcircle of triangle XYZ}$.\n\n"

We let $f(0) = 1$ for convenience.  \nFrom here, we proceed by induction, with our claim being that the only $n$ such that $f(n)$ is odd are $n$ representable of the form $2^{a} - 1, a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\nWe induct on $a$.  It is trivially true for $a = 0$ and $a = 1$.  From here, we show that, if the only numbers $n \\le 2^{a-1} - 1$ where $f(n)$ is odd are of the form described above, then the only numbers $n \\le 2^{a} -1$ that are odd are of that form.  We first consider all numbers $b$, such that $2^{a-1} \\le b \\le 2^{a} - 2$, going from the lower bound to the upper bound (a mini induction, you might say).  We know that $f(b) = \\sum_{i=0}^{a-1} f(b-2^{i})$.  For a number in this summation to be odd, $b - 2^i = 2^m -1 \\rightarrow b = 2^i + 2^m - 1$.  However, we know that $b > 2^{a-1}$, so $m$ must be equal to $a-1$, or else $b$ cannot be in that interval.  Now, from this, we know that $i < a-1$, as $b<2^{a} - 1$.  Therefore, $i$ and $m$ are distinct, and thus $f(b - 2^i)$ and $f(b- 2^{a-1})$ are odd; since there are just two odd numbers, the ending sum for any $b$ is even.  Finally, considering $2^{a} - 1$, the only odd number is $f(2^{a} - 1 - 2^{a-1})$, so the ending sum is odd.  $\\Box$\nThe smallest $n$ greater than $2013$ expressible as $2^d - 1, d \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is $2^{11} -1 = \\boxed{2047}$",

I will call this sum the Divine Sign, or DS.\nBut wait a minute... we are trying to determine odd/even of $f(n)$. Why not call all the evens 0 and odds 1, basically using mod 2? Sounds so simple. Draw a small table for the values: as $n$ goes up from $0$, you get: $1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0...$. We have to set $f(0)=1$ for this to work. Already it looks like $f(n)$ is only odd if $n=2^{\\textrm{power}}-1$.\nThe only tool here is induction. The base case is clearly established. Then let's assume we successfully made our claim up to $2^n-1$. We need to visit numbers from $2^n$ to $2^{n+1}-1$. Realize that $2^n$ has $0$ for $f$ because there will be two numbers in DS that give a $f$ of one: $2^{n-1}$ and $1$. \nBut to look at whether a value of $f(\\textrm{number})$ is 1 or 0, we need to revisit our first equation. We can answer this rather natural question: When will a number to be inducted upon, say $2^n+k$, ever have a 1 as $f(\\textrm{number})$ in the DS equation? Well- because by our assumption of the claim up to $2^n-1$, we know that the only way for that to happen is if $2^n+k-2^{\\textrm{power}}$ in the DS is equal to $2^{\\textrm{Some power}} - 1$. Clearly $1 \\leq k \\leq 2^n - 1$.\nFinally, we can simplify. Using our last equation, $2^n+k-2^{\\textrm{power}}=2^{\\textrm{Some power}}-1$, regrouping gives $2^n+k=2^{\\textrm{power}}+2^{\\textrm{Some power}}-1$. \nMost importantly, realize that $\\textrm{power}$ can be from $0$ to $n$, because of the restraints on $k$ mentioned earlier. Same with $\\textrm{Some power}$. Immediately at least one of $\\textrm{power}$ and $\\textrm{Some power}$ has to be $n$. If both were smaller, LHS is greater, contradiction. If both were greater, RHS is greater, contradiction.\nTherefore, by setting one of $\\textrm{power}$ or $\\textrm{Some power}$ to $n$, we realize $k=2^{\\textrm{A certain power}}-1$.\nThe conclusion is clear, right? Each $k$ from $1$ to $2^{n-1}-1$ yields two distinct cases: one of $\\textrm{power}$ and $\\textrm{Some power}$ is equal to $n$, while the other is LESS THAN $n$. But for $k=2^n-1$, there is ONE CASE: BOTH values have to equal $n$. Therefore, the only $k$ that has $f(2^n+k)$ as odd must only be $2^n-1$, because the other ones yield a $f$ of 1+1=0 in our mod. That proves our induction for a new power of 2, namely $n+1$, meaning that $f(\\textrm{number})$ is only odd if $\\textrm{number} = 2^{\\textrm{Power of two}} - 1$, and we are almost done...\nThus, the answer is $2^{11}-1=\\boxed{2047}$."

Because this problem is a #6, the crown jewel of USAJMO problems, we do not hesitate in computing the messy computations:\n\\[u^2(yz) - u(2\\sqrt{y-1} + 2\\sqrt{z-1}) + (3 + yz - y - z - 2\\sqrt{(y-1)(z-1)}) \\ge 0\\]\nBecause the coefficient of $u^2$ is positive, all we need to do is to verify that the discriminant is nonpositive:\n\\[b^2 - 4ac = 4(y-1) + 4(z-1) - 8\\sqrt{(y-1)(z-1)} - yz(12 + 4yz - 4y - 4z - 8\\sqrt{(y-1)(z-1)})\\]\nLet us try a few examples. If y = z, then the discriminant D = $8(y-1) - 8(y-1) - yz(12 + 4y^2 - 8y - 8(y-1)) = -yz(4y^2 - 16y + 20) = -4yz(y^2 - 4y + 5) < 0$.\nWe are almost done, but we need to find the correct argument. (How frustrating!)\nSuccess! The discriminant is negative. Thus, we can replace our claim with a strict one, and there are no real solutions to the original equation in the hypothesis."
